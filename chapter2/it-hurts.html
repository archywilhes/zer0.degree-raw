            <p>It hurts.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know I will never meet someone like you again.</p>
<p>It hurts because you are the woman I would love to grow old with.</p>
<p>It hurts because you flirted me with once while you were really drunk.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know you care about me.</p>
<p>It hurts because I believe what we have there is special.</p>
<p>It hurts because I wish we can cuddle more instead of just a little hug at the end of the day.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know about sex and love and love is a lot harder than sex and I want to fall in love again.</p>
<p>It hurts because I want to fall in love with a woman that worths my existential time.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know I won’t want to meet you again, despite how much I adore you.</p>
<p>It hurts because I have met deaths many times and I want to make things right this life.</p>
<p>It hurts because I want to be the one that makes things right in your life, and you in mine.</p>
<p>It hurts because I want to take acid with you again, but not as friends. And discover the meaning of life together. And then have crazy good fuckings until we are dead.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know things will not be the same with the next girl (or guy that smells nice who I’m sexually attracted to), unless I get extremely lucky, which is statistically improbable or it will be in a different setting and I am growing old and it will be new memories and it will not be you.</p>
<p>It hurts because I believe in Synchronizität <a href="#theEnd"><sup>[1]</sup><a></a> and I believe there is a reason I have met you.</p>
<p>It hurts because I really appreciate the time we spent together and a part of me would love to stay friends.</p>
<p>It hurts because perhaps the reason I meet you is to feel this beautiful feeling of hurt so I will become a millionaire and a psychopath, or an artist, in the remaining time of my life.</p>
<p>It hurts because I really like you as a friend and I believe the connection we have made is something special that will grow into something really beautiful.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know I won’t want to meet you again, despite how much I enjoy the sophisticated side of you.</p>
<p>It hurts because the clumsy side of you is super cute too, though I have fallen for the sophistication and the sadness in your eyes.</p>
<p>It hurts because I will never meet you and never get to discover more about this sophisticated side of you. But that is beautiful in itself too.</p>
<p>It hurts because you are always sleeping with guys much less sophisticated than you.</p>
<p>It hurts because I also know that in order to sleep with you like the other men I would have to belittle you and insult you and play with your feelings when you are drunk and make you feel shitty about yourself and turn you into my little sex slave despite how tired you are from work (and maybe you would regret it the next day? Nah, you won’t. I take responsibility.)</p>
<p>It hurts because I am not a good flirt and I don’t intend to be one because I would rather spend more time doing more meaningful things than hitting on girls that are drunk like one of those boring fucks that slept with you who, despite owning a THC vaporizer, isn’t even aware of the emerging billion-dollar weed tech industry. I guess he is hot though.</p>
<p>It hurts because I went drinking Wednesday night so you can have sex with this dude with a THC vaporizer that has been hitting on you and who you are attracted to too (perhaps because you are really drunk?), because I want you to have a great night and good sex but it turns out to be another night where (the fucking is bad?) and which you regretted having. The Wednesday night, oh, instead of drinking meaninglessly in bar I could have disarmed that dude and make him feel really shitty about himself and go back with you to have a little joint before you sleep. I know how to make people feel shitty about themselves. And I know how to make people feel great about themselves. For this reason I don’t want to insult you and then sleep with you when you are drunk. I believe you appreciated that too.</p>
<p>It hurts because I just want to have a meaningful life, with someone like you.</p>
<p>It hurts because I have lived in your room and read your books.</p>
<p>It hurts because I want to invite you to Singapore and China.</p>
<p>It hurts because I want to introduce formal logic and programming to you. I want to make arts and all sorts of things with you. We can have a child. My parents will be so proud. Yours will be proud too.</p>
<p>It hurts because I don’t want to see you again.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know when I become rich and successful in the next few years and if you are still unmarried I will come looking for you.</p>
<p>Or I won’t.</p>
<p>It hurts but it was good, wasn’t it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for everything. A part of me really love you, this is why I won’t want to meet you again.</p>
