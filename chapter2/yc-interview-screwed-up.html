            We screwed up our YC interview and here are what we learnt
        </h2>
        <div class="text">
            <h5 id="prologue">0. Prologue</h5>
<p>My sister Evelyn and I are co-foundering a start-up based in Singapore and we are extremely fortunate to have been invited and selected as the first<sup><a href="#a0">[0]</a></sup> interviewee for <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-china-qi-lu/">YC China</a> Winter 2019. And we screwed up. It is fair to say we had been a disappointment and an embarrassment. And we are really sorry for Qi Lu and the 4 YC partners who were there and had to put up with an unpleasant surprise like this early in the morning on the first day. On the other hand we are extremely grateful to YC and everyone involved for this unique opportunity. Here are what we learnt.</p>
<h5 id="behavioural-sugar-coating-ruins-everything.">1. Behavioural sugar-coating ruins everything.</h5>
<p>I am one of those humans who are straightforward and speak in an unfiltered manner as I don’t like wasting time <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">(both mine and others’)</a>, but that often means I pay less attention to the possibilities of how different people may interpret my words very differently, and more on the content of my delivery. And never be able to make small talks (which by definition have no content). Certainly a plus for the YC Interview. Meanwhile, Evelyn is a friendly human, not always as straightforward as I am but much better at socialising. She has a natural tendency to slip away from <em>negativity</em> and portrait reality in a <em>positive</em> light. This tendency can sometimes over-compress details in order to manufacture <em>positive</em> images, under-exemplify ideas deemed <em>negative</em> with inconclusive anecdotes to prove the contrary and maintain <em>positiveness</em>, etc, basically resulting in an atmosphere of <em>positivity</em>. Useful for things like making friends and project management. Not useful for things like depicting reality accurately and project management. And definitely not useful in a YC interview.</p>
<p>Before the interview Evelyn and I had constantly reminded ourselves to be crisp and not to sugar-coat. And yet during the interview limited to 10 minutes we had outputted only 3 minutes worth of information. Evelyn spoke at x0.75 and sugar-coated 90% of her content. At one point she misunderstood a question and got nervous and threw a sales pitch intended to excite a none-tech audience. (Yup, in front of Qi Lu and 4 YC Partners.) I watched in horror as everyone cringed. It was really bad. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-7fzHy3aG0">Kellyanne Conway</a> bad. So when I was finally given the chance to interrupt I did everything I could to be crisp and informative and spoke at ~170 words a minute. Completely forgot that my Cantonese and Singaporean accents may further obscure the already condensed audio content. I missed some important points as well. Nonetheless I’m very glad to have interrupted (or I would have been so ashamed of myself for not doing anything).</p>
<p>Overall the interview moved at an extremely slow rate with long-winded sugar-coating from Evelyn that is more behavioural than intentional. As a whole I didn’t get to speak much and we certainly didn’t manage to present ourselves the way we wanted. And I think it is very rude of us to have wasted everyone’s time.</p>
<h5 id="a-none-verbal-communication-protocol-among-co-founders-would-be-useful.">2. A none-verbal communication protocol among co-founders would be useful.</h5>
<p>A lot of what happened (especially the sales pitch) could have been avoided had we defined among ourselves a none-verbal communication protocol such as kicking another person’s leg as a request to interrupt<sup><a href="#a1">[1]</a></sup>. Or sending a signal with secret hand gestures. Just to make sure the other co-founder who is desperate to interrupt wouldn’t need to resort to waiting for the right moment (which can often take very long) or interrupting in a manner that may come across as being abrupt and rude (minus point for co-founder relationship). This protocol can also be used by the speaking person to invite the other co-founder(s) to interrupt since it is often hard to terminate when one has started babbling (as noted by Evelyn).</p>
<p>It will also come in handy if each co-founder computes an elapsed time based on a confidence score before they decide to answer an interview question. This way the question would always be answered by the most confident co-founder. And a co-founder would not feel obligated to give an immediate answer when they are doubtful of their delivery.</p>
<h5 id="living-under-the-same-roof-keeps-ideas-in-sync-much-efficiently.">3. Living under the same roof keeps ideas in sync much efficiently.</h5>
<p>Evelyn and I have been collaborating remotely for a while now. We met in person two days before the YC interview and I presented to her some new ideas for the product, many of which were inspired by conversations we had during the Skype and WeChat calls. We had a good discussion and documented everything, convinced we were on the same page.</p>
<p>But we weren’t.</p>
<p>During the interview it had become apparent that Evelyn was pitching the product she had been showing to our potential users and clients in the past one month. This was the product to test if we could achieve early-stage sustainability<sup><a href="#a2">[2]</a></sup> and it turned out we likely couldn’t. So it was a failure by itself and we learnt a lot from it. What we intended to present to YC was an improved version of this product and with a different target audience. It is scalable and sustainable in many ways. We initially imagined during the interview we would talk briefly about what we had made (i.e. the failed product), how our potential users and clients reacted, and moved on elegantly to the new vision which was supposed to be the main dish of the day. But Evelyn got stuck in her own sugar-coating with her focus still fixated on the failed product as we failed to make an elegant transition.</p>
<p>To put it in the words of a wise antique dealer, it takes time for ideas to instil themselves into the mind, and it is only then one can articulate these ideas clearly in front of strangers despite nervousness.</p>
<p>This is a good reason why living under the same roof is important for start-up at its infancy when everything is dynamic and ad hoc. The same-roof arrangement enables meetings to be effortlessly scheduled in an on-demand manner, making it much easier for each other to communicate new ideas without always bothering with the organisation, formalisation and documentation. This way the co-founders are constantly letting new ideas from each other to evolve and dissolve into consciousness, keeping everyone’s version of the ideas up-to-date and pretty much in sync (which would take a longer time over telecommunication).</p>
<h5 id="cheer-up.">4. Cheer up.</h5>
<p>Maybe the interview didn’t go as horribly as I remembered. We were just not at the right stage yet and thus the natural screw-up. We had some traction but were still uncertain about many things. We had no active users. No revenue. Only clients who signed up for free trials. And an unfinished app. And we are facing a variation of the chicken-and-egg problem where there are two types of chickens and they are in a love-hate relationship and none of them know a lot about the eggs which work in a mysterious way. We are still in the midst of figuring out how to go around this problem. Maybe by introducing a new kind of eggs and seeing how the system evolves as the market responses. A lot of uncertainty.</p>
<p>We’re still waiting for YC to get back to us, although looking at the damage we have done we are pretty sure it is a rejection and we are cool with that. We are super grateful for this whole thing because we have learnt so much from it. And after experiencing a screw-up like this, which is so surreal, Evelyn and I have become sharper and more productive at work.</p>
<p>We will stay focus and keep shipping. And apply for YC again next year.</p>
