            We screwed up our YC interview
        </h2>
        <div class="text">
            <h5 id="prologue">0. Prologue</h5>
<p>A few days ago my co-founder/sister Evelyn and I went to Beijing for an interview for <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-china-qi-lu/">YC China</a> Winter 2019. We were the first to be interviewed<sup><a href="#a0">[0]</a></sup>. Nice.</p>
<p>And we screwed up horribly.</p>
<p>It must have been an unpleasant surprise for Qi Lu and the 4 YC partners who were there. We are deeply sorry about that.</p>
<p>In this article I would be sharing some mistakes we made and what we’ve learnt.</p>
<h5 id="be-careful-of-behavioural-sugar-coating.">1. Be careful of behavioural sugar-coating.</h5>
<p>I am one of those humans who are straightforward and often speak in an unfiltered manner as I don’t like wasting time <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">(both mine and others’)</a>. That often means I pay less attention to how different people may interpret my words very differently, and more on the content of my delivery. And never be able to make proper small talks (which by definition have no content). Certainly a plus for the YC Interview. Meanwhile, Evelyn is a friendly human, not always as straightforward as I am but much better at socialising. She has a natural tendency to slip away from <em>negativity</em> and portrait reality in a <em>positive</em> light. This tendency can sometimes over-compress details in order to manufacture <em>positive</em> images, under-exemplify ideas deemed <em>negative</em> with inconclusive anecdotes to prove the contrary and maintain <em>positiveness</em>, etc, basically resulting in an atmosphere of <em>positivity</em>. Useful for things like making friends and project management. Not useful for things like depicting reality accurately and project management. And definitely not useful in a YC interview.</p>
<p>Before the interview Evelyn and I had reminded ourselves many times to be crisp and not to sugar-coat. And yet during the interview limited to 10 minutes we had outputted only 3 minutes worth of information. There was an excessive amount of sugar-coating from Evelyn as she tried to give positive answers to every interview question. That resulted in bad time management. And just made her even more nervous as she could gradually see that she was not going anywhere with these sugar-coatings. At one point she misunderstood a question and threw a sales pitch intended to excite a none-tech audience, which was certainly not something she intended to do in front of Qi Lu and 4 YC Partners. I watched in horror as everyone cringed. So when I was finally given the chance to speak I did everything possible to be crisp and informative and spoke at ~170 words a minute. But I completely forgot that my Cantonese and Singaporean accents might have further obscured the already condensed audio content. I missed a couple of important points as well. Nonetheless I was able to speed up the conversation and I got the impressions that they liked my answers especially the brutally honest ones (though I’m not sure how much of that are true rid the confirmation bias).</p>
<p>Overall the interview moved at a slow speed with long-winded sugar-coating from Evelyn (accounting for 80% of the interview) and a little bit accelerations here and there from me. As a whole I didn’t get to speak much, which I regret a lot. In summary Evelyn’s behavioural sugar-coating resulted in a huge loss of time, and we have painted a very messy picture of what our start-up is about.</p>
<h5 id="dont-pitch-to-yc-and-potential-shareholders-like-you-are-pitching-to-a-customer.">2. Don’t pitch to YC (and potential shareholders) like you are pitching to a customer.</h5>
<p>A start-up is a human system (also founded by 2 or 3 human entities) interacting with the outside world. To a start-up, YC (and potential shareholders) are systems and entities that are looking to integrate internally. Meanwhile, customers/users are systems and entities that a start-up interacts with on a transactional basis i.e. a part of the outside world. When you pitch to customers you are eventually delivering feelings to them in hopes of achieving transactional relationship that will bring value to your start-up, which is why start-ups talk about Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) like they are vampires. But when you are pitching to entities and systems that are looking to integrate internally, you are basically welcoming them to join you on a journey to build transactional relationships with potential customers and increase CLV and become billionaires. Therefore when you pitch to these entities you should never pitch like you are pitching to your customers, and instead go one or two meta-levels up and pitch to them like you are talking to your co-founder.</p>
<p>Therefore it is always better for the co-founder that is more straightforward and capable of going many meta-levels up to pitch to to YC and potential shareholders.</p>
<h5 id="implement-a-none-verbal-communication-protocol-among-co-founders.">3. Implement a none-verbal communication protocol among co-founders.</h5>
<p>A lot of what happened during the interview (such as the sales pitch and horrible time management) could have been avoided had we defined among ourselves a none-verbal communication protocol such as kicking another person’s leg as a request to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</a><sup><a href="#a1">[1]</a></sup>. Or sending a signal with secret hand gestures. Just to make sure the other co-founder desperate to speak wouldn’t need to resort to waiting for the right moment (which often means losing more time) or interrupt in a manner that may come across as abrupt and rude (minus point for co-founder relationship).</p>
<p>It will also come in handy if each co-founder computes an elapsed time based on a confidence score before they decide to answer an interview question. This way the question would always be answered by the most confident co-founder. And a co-founder would not feel obligated to give an immediate answer that would often turn into babbling when they are doubtful of their delivery.</p>
<h5 id="live-under-the-same-roof.">4. Live under the same roof.</h5>
<p>Evelyn and I have been collaborating remotely. We met in person two days before the interview and I presented to her some new ideas for the product, many of which inspired by conversations we had during the Skype and WeChat calls from the past few weeks. We had a good discussion and documented everything, convinced we were on the same page.</p>
<p>However, during the interview it had become apparent that Evelyn was pitching the product she had been showing to our potential users and customers in the past one month. This was the product designed to test if we could achieve early-stage sustainability<sup><a href="#a2">[2]</a></sup> which turned out to be highly unlikely. So it was a failure by itself and we learnt a lot from it. What we intended to present to YC was an improved version of this product and with a different target audience. It is more scalable and can be sustainable in many ways. Our plan was to talk briefly about the old version and what we had learnt, and bring the spotlight to the new version i.e. the main dish of the day. But when Evelyn was answering the interview questions she leaned towards the more familiar connotations she had with the product, which were those of the old. Then there came the behavioural sugar-coating. The bad time management. The lack of none-verbal communication protocol. And the introduction to the main dish was further delayed.</p>
<p>It takes time for new ideas to instil themselves into the mind. One can be at ease with these ideas only when there is a sense of familiarity to them as these ideas get more integrated with the existing constructs in the subconscious mind. And then one can articulate these ideas with clarity and confidence in front of strangers.</p>
<p>Living under the same roof is important for start-up at early stage when everything is dynamic and ad hoc. The same-roof arrangement enables meetings to be effortlessly scheduled and conducted in an on-demand manner, making it much easier for each other to communicate new ideas without always bothering with formalisation, organisation and documentation (which all have their pros and cons). It is the readily availability and flexibilities of choosing when to formalise and when not, when to organise or not, etc, that make a huge difference. Readily availability can still be enforced during remote collaboration although it would require trainings. Meanwhile, you lose this flexibility when there are structures imposed on the scheduling of meetings and the meetings themselves which naturally arise for the sake of efficiency during remote collaboration or when things are less ad hoc in nature.</p>
<h5 id="cheer-up.">5. Cheer up.</h5>
<p>Maybe the interview didn’t go as horribly as I remembered. We were just not at the right stage yet and thus the natural didn’t-go-according-to-plan. We had some traction but were still uncertain about many things. We had no active users. No revenue. Only customers who signed up for free trials. And an unfinished app. No product market fit yet. And we are facing a variation of the chicken-and-egg problem that is likely NP-complete. A lot of uncertainty indeed.</p>
<p>And we have just started working together. The fact that we didn’t manage to present ourselves the way we wanted also says a lot about us as a team.</p>
<p>We are still waiting for YC to get back to us, although looking at the damage we have done we are not optimistic<sup>[3]</sup>. We are super grateful that this happened because we have learnt so much from it. After experiencing a screw-up like this - so surrealistic in nature - Evelyn and I have become sharper and more crisp.</p>
<p>We will stay focus and keep shipping. And apply for YC again next year.</p>
