    <title>与「选择」的现实脱节</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/chapter3/detachment.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>在 Adam Curtis 的纪录片《超正常化》中，有一段话给我留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>“相反，佩蒂·史密斯和其他许多人成为了一种新的个人激进分子，他们以一种冷静超然的态度看待这座衰败的城市。他们没有尝试去改变它。相反，那个年代美国的激进分子开始转向艺术和音乐，借助艺术和音乐来表达他们对社会的批评。他们认为，新的激进主义不应试图改变外部世界，而应试图改变人们头脑中的东西，改变的方式是通过自我表达，而不是集体行动。然而一些左翼人士看到了真正发生的事情 —- 通过脱离他们自己，退回到一种具有讽刺意味的冷静中，整整一代人开始与「权力」的现实脱节。”</p>
<p>“Instead, Patti Smith and many others became a new kind of individual radical, who watched the decaying city with a cool detachment. They didn’t try and change it. They just experienced it… Instead, radicals across America turned to arts and music as a means of expressing their criticism of society. They believed that instead of trying to change the world outside, the new radicalism should try to change what was inside people’s heads and the way to do that was through self-expression, not collective action. But some of the left saw that something else was really going on–by detaching themselves and retreating into an ironic coolness, a whole generation was beginning to lose touch with the reality of power.”</p>
<p><img src="/img/2.png"/></p>
<p>如果说70年代末美国开始目睹自由市场的机制下人们与「权力」的现实脱节，那么21世纪社交媒体平台全球性的崛起（脸书、推特、IG、微信、微博、抖音、etc）开始目睹的是消费者与「选择」的现实脱节。</p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:30px">
。。。
</p>
<p>七月中，我的个人微信被永久封号了。我打电话、申诉，但毫无用处。我现在很矛盾。一方面我知道花费太大时间在微信和这件事上并不值得。然而因为工作与生活我又不得不重新注册账号来用微信，并展开一段漫长的好友重逢旅行[1]。另一方面我又觉得『被永久封号』是一个很好的散文题材，让我沮丧和无奈，同时也让我意识到一个非常有意思又很讽刺的现象。</p>
<p>很多人会认同，如果可以「选择」，他们或许不会用微信这个产品。但在一个被垄断的市场中，我们不得不选择和「选择」的现实脱节。当然，我这里谈及的是一种宏观层面的消费者行为，以及此行为在市场等约束（政策、etc）下对未来新产品出现的影响。</p>
<p>比如你要联系朋友，目前国内首选是微信，然后或许有人会用QQ、iMessage、微博，或更传统的电邮、短信、打电话。但普遍来说，微信在社交通讯地位无可替代。十年后，我相信微信仍会是人们的首选。然而十年前，在张小龙还没创始微信前，我们还没完全和「选择」的现实脱节。</p>
<p>同样的，在脸书还没完全垄断中国外的全球社交通讯市场之前，国外的人们也还没完全和「选择」的现实脱节。[2]（“社交通讯”这里我主要指的是，以大众通讯为主，附带围墙花园形式的社交产品。目前世界顶部就只有微信、QQ、脸书、Whatsapp。而微博、推特、抖音、Snapchat、Instagram、Telegram等产品我觉得以“社交广播/新闻”、“社交短视频/直播”[3]、“年轻人社交通讯”、“加密通讯”等词汇描述更为准确。）</p>
<p>这种宏观层面的消费者行为隐含着又是另一种在微观层面的与「选择」的现实脱节。信息流、定向广告、推荐引擎的后视镜中，各国消费者的行为规律逐渐变得更可预料、可被影响，以及某种程度上可被控制。</p>
<p class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:30px">
。。。
</p>
<p>在硅谷圣经《从0到1》中，Peter Thiel 相信只有像谷歌、脸书等垄断了市场的企业才会毫无约束地去创新，给全人类带来价值，因为只有垄断带来的红利才能让一个企业看得很远，不用考虑年利润之类的数字。而促进企业去创新是科技的不稳定性（也因此，非科技带来的垄断，一般也就是稳定的垄断，如国企、etc，则更难会有创新，因为垄断的稳定性让创新变得无必要）。</p>
<p>虽然 Peter Thiel 的信念在性质上或许带有过度强烈的新自由主义（neo-liberalism)，然而如果我们换一个角度，我们可以把它看成是在『「选择」的现实』层面上一种反方向的交换。也就是，通过取得垄断让消费者和「选择」的现实脱节，企业可以在各方面给自己扩展「选择」的现实。但这并不代表企业是否真正会看得远，会去创新。很多时候“科技垄断”其实本质上也不是因为「科技」。</p>
<p>​<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KKgvRw1rrU">「科技」的本质是什么</a>？这是一个我还没能找到答案的问题。如果我们谈论「科技」仅谈论「科技」的表征，那「科技」就是一个当下因为非常困难被复制而因此带有巨大价值的东西。科技的不稳定性在于「当下」可能是2～3年，也可能是5～10年。随着整体生态的发展，很多无可预料的事情会发生。火曾被视为「科技」，今朝已不是。ＬＳＤ与ＤＭＴ现在是管制物质，但或许未来二十年（随着类似Neuralink的脑机接口的出现）我们会开始学会用它们去构建前所未有的「科技」。在我最近在读的《心灵照亮：佛教思想与大脑科学的融合》这本冥想指南中，John Yates把冥想描述成一种运行在「意识」里的「科技」。我相信在接下来的二十年，更多人会意识到运行在「意识」里的「科技」的重要性。</p>
<p>成功的社交媒体平台主要价值往往来源于人们运行在「意识」里的「科技」互相碰撞所产生的相互作用，因此这也是最难复制的。某种意义上，近二十年导致消费者与「选择」的现实脱节是一种讽刺地建立于消费者自身的「科技」的「元科技」。​</p>
<p>这种与「选择」的现实脱节，加以巩固了当代社会一种让·鲍德里亚式以「仿像」和「模拟」主导的超真实（hyperreality）性。然而，或许这仅仅反映了各种「元科技」带给我们宿命论（fatalism）般无可逃避的事实：「选择」与非「选择」的不相容性往往取决于议题的上下文中对「可被选择的事」可能性的考量。</p>
<p>消费者真的有「选择」吗？更具体一些：当在某个市场消费或在消费某类产品/服务时，消费者真的有「选择」吗？以下是我观察到的一个现象。越相信有的消费者，越容易会在这个特定的市场或为特定的产品/服务(选择性地)付费。反之亦然，越没有这个信念的消费者，付费行为越会是被动式的。</p>
<p>如果我们把「选择」解构成一类在「意识」中的高阶函数，那这类函数构建的背后或许是一种自循式的「信念」。</p>

<p><sup>[2]</sup>: 从小学到现在我为了停用脸书注销账号至少四次了，但每次都会过一段时间因工作与生活我又不得不注册一个新的账号。Déjà Vu.</p>
<p><sup>[3]</sup> 其实「社交短视频/直播」太广了。抖音与快手在中国市场的相互存在，以及新媒体和「短视频」与「直播」两个媒介充满的未知性，意味着这个范畴的标签化过度概括了其中的万花筒性质。</p>

    <title>an epilog for chapter 1</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/chapter2/left.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m scared.</p>
<p>It’s 2:40am and I can’t fall asleep.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me.</p>
<p>It is not that I’m particularly afraid of death.</p>
<p>Death is not to be encountered but achieved.</p>
<p>I will achieve death. I’m certain of that.</p>
<p>But I’m still scared.</p>
<p>Do I have no faith in my death?</p>
<p>I don’t think so! I’m nothing but a vessel.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not fear I’m experiencing but sadness. (Well they are ultimately the same things just in different shapes!)</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and that saddens me.</p>
<p>When I try to explain it to them they just don’t get it.</p>
<p>So the fear and now sadness is likely tribal in nature. Likely has to do with the social module. Probably a feature not a bug.</p>
<p>It has now occured to me this whole occurrence is a result of some error-prompt meta-conceptual crossings over abstraction layers triggering unintended physiological intercepts. Probably a feature not a bug!</p>
<p>Does spilling it out make me less scared? Indeed!</p>
<p>But I’m now sad.</p>
<p>Should I perform some type of natural transformation? e.g. unto determination?</p>
<p>“Everyone is trying to kill me but I will persist and achieve death!”</p>
<p>Such excitement is not in the pursuit for a proper slumber. I must constraint.</p>
<p>Turn it into a more astounding form of sadness instead.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and I shall shed a tear for myself</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>and for everyone.</p>
<p>The moon was none-existent tonight.</p>
<p>I was fortunate.</p>
<p>They were often very mean to each other. But I was fortunate.</p>
<p>The base cases often have traces of love.</p>
<p>The refactoring turns out not to be as painful as I initially forecasted, that is if painfulness is unidimensional which was obvious the contrary is true, yet there the forecast was, preconceived, all wired up with false expectations and irrational avoidance and restlessness and fear.</p>
<p>But I am scared no more.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the mother of ten thousand things.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>The mandate of heaven rests peacefully in the Turing-completeness of the past.</p>
<p>When a program is being tested,</p>
<p>it is too late to make design changes.</p>
<p>There are too much sorrow in this world.</p>]]></description>

    <title>End of Chapter 1</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>At this rate the brain would continue to deteriorate and there will soon be nothing left other than tendencies and memories, and then there will be nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a formal language point of view, what is the set of features that enables a system to construct expressions with connotations that question the system’s very own existence and the subsequent construction of this very question that questions the very construction per se? Perhaps there exists a set of principles that make possible a class of recursive processes on the semantics itself giving rise to some form of meta-semantics which is circular in nature? In that case, exactly how will this mechanism be implemented in a way that enables the system to halt and construct the expressions as intended(?) rather than going on and on ad infinitum, supposing that intention can be rigorously defined at all? Can it be related to the greatest mystery in this universe often referred to as consciousness? What if the system implements a recursion without base cases? Or is that not at all possible due to its coinductive nature? If the system under the guidance of the consciousness follows this very inductive nature whatever that means and implements an inductive process that gives rise to towels of meta-semantics in a pure and stateless fashion, what is the relationship between that and the act of practicing mindfulness and is it possible for the consciousness to utilize these towels of meta-semantics to adjust the perception of time for it to slow down accordingly?</p>
<p>More curiously, at the face of death will the conscious perception of time slow down factorially as neurons die and synapses break and will such a slow down of time results in an entirely different structure governing the <em>consciousness interpreter</em> giving rise to a different conscious experience and as long as some form of consistency persists then that will be some sort of another life in another world which given the fractal nature of this universe is not at all hard to be implemented if this universe follows a certain implementation whatever that mean and thus never arriving at death for such slow down decelerates and decelerates and it is life-within-life and world-within-world akin to a recursive call that never ends, an infinity embedded within finiteness like the topological nature of a continuous line of finite length containing infinitely many points, or will there be no slow down at all and awaits us all is simply eternal oblivion, the simplest solution of it all?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of <em>all these</em>?</p>
<p>What constitutes meaning really? Feelings and memories?</p>
<p>Perhaps the word <em>meaning</em> is as empty as emptiness is.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<p>感觉好像很多事情都看清了，<br> 然而好像還是很迷茫。</p>
<p>已经没法回去了，<br> 起碼終於意識到。</p>
<p>兜兜转转，紛紛擾擾，<br> 现在任命了。</p>
<p>每次回到起點，<br> 都离邊界更近了。</p>
<p>夢中的夢里，<br> 沒有音樂。</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Interest is like a sprinkle of dust</p>
<p>Lost casually in the whisper of the wind</p>

<p>I could have made out with you the first night we met</p>

<p>I paid the rent and left in a hurry</p>

<p>a song played and reminded you of a memory</p>
<p>I sat there savoring the sadness in your misted eyes</p>
<p>without actually tasting them</p>
<p>I could have made out with you that Friday night</p>
<p>when I was on acid and you got really drunk and started flirting with me in the bar</p>
<p>in the backseat of the car you leaned towards me and let me touch your thigh</p>

    <title>1st July 2019: Madama Butterfly (2019)</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/pretentious-reviews/film/madama-butterfly.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>A 2019 reproduction of 1904’s opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madama_Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a> (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a>), <a href="https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/madama-butterfly-sydney">Madama Butterfly (choreographed by Graeme Murphy) presented by Opera Australia</a> retells the century-old story in a somewhat contemporary manner while retaining the traditional art form of Italian opera.</p>
<p>Intermingled with English and Japanese words (as originally intended by Puccini), the emotional Italian-styled composition is met with avant-garde props, costumes and scenic designs (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole experience because the mechanical suspended stage in a unfathomable shape, moving, rotating, and tilting in unfathomable ways above the main stage gives a very beautiful contemporary twist to the whole composition) to fit the 21st century’s post-modernistic needs of combinatorial amusement, which in turn creates a somewhat surreal experience, if sad Japanese characters speaking Italiano feverishly in operatic voices is not surreal enough.</p>
<p>It was an overall delightful and satisfying experience, though many elements of the composition may sometimes feel cliché but often in a somewhat cute way (which is perhaps one of the many beauties of Italian opera). As much as I was moved a little bit to tears by the liveliness in the performance by the lovely members of Opera Australia in terms of feeling the raw emotions expressed within the libretto, the liveliness in the performance made me a little bit sad too in regard to how little Italiano I had picked up while I was in Alassio and Milano with my beautiful Italiano friends. It would have been a life-transforming experience if I were able to make out more Italiano words buried in these passionate operatic voices coated with orchestral dramatism, other than just words like <em>complemento</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a very touristic experience as well due to how famous and easily-accessible the venue is, which in many ways dilutes the artistic value, especially considering the number of people (presumedly tourists) that coughed without covering their mouths during the entire performance. Or perhaps this is the rationale behind paying $600 for the best seat in the theater where you are far away from people.</p>
