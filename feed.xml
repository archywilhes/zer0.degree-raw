    <title>I won't let you die before death is achieved. I promise. (That is if we are in the right reality. If not we should leave soon!)</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/chapter3/scared.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’m scared.</p>
<p>It’s 2:40am and I can’t fall asleep.</p>
<p>I am scared.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me.</p>
<p>It is not that I’m particularly afraid of death.</p>
<p>Death is not to be encountered but achieved.</p>
<p>I will achieve death. I’m certain of that.</p>
<p>But I’m still scared.</p>
<p>Do I have no faith in my death?</p>
<p>I don’t think so!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is not fear I’m experiencing but sadness. (Well they are ultimately the same things just in different shapes!)</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and that saddens me.</p>
<p>When I try to explain it to them they just don’t get it.</p>
<p>So the fear and now sadness is likely tribal in nature. Likely has to do with the social module. Probably a feature not a bug.</p>
<p>It has now occured to me that this whole thing is a result of some error-prompt conceptual crossings over abstraction layers triggering unintended physiological intercepts. Probably a feature not a bug!</p>
<p>Does spilling it out make me less scared? Indeed!</p>
<p>But I’m now sad.</p>
<p>Should I perform some type of natural transformation? e.g. unto determination?</p>
<p>“Everyone is trying to kill me but I will persist and achieve death!”</p>
<p>Such excitement is not in the pursuit for a proper slumber. I must constraint.</p>
<p>Turn it into another form of sadness instead. The it’s-beautiful-because-it’s-sad kind of sad.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to kill me and I shall shred a tear for myself</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>and for everyone.</p>
<p>The moon was none-existent tonight.</p>
<p>I was fortunate.</p>
<p>They were often very mean to each other. But I was fortunate.</p>
<p>The base cases often have traces of love.</p>
<p>The refactoring turns out to be not as painful as I initially forecasted, that is if painfulness is unidimensional which was obvious the contrary is true, yet there the forecast was, preconceived, all wired up with the false expectation, the irrational avoidance, the restlessness, the fear.</p>
<p>There are many shades to the painfulness that has surfaced itself without cease.</p>
<p>But I do not want to get too much into it right now. I’m tired.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My 5HT2A receptors need some rest!</p>]]></description>

    <title>End of Chapter 1</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>At this rate the brain would continue to deteriorate and there will soon be nothing left other than tendencies and memories, and then there will be nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a formal language point of view, what is the set of features that enables a system to construct expressions with connotations that question the system’s very own existence and the subsequent construction of this very question that questions the very construction per se? Perhaps there exists a set of principles that make possible a class of recursive processes on the semantics itself giving rise to some form of meta-semantics which is circular in nature? In that case, exactly how will this mechanism be implemented in a way that enables the system to halt and construct the expressions as intended(?) rather than going on and on ad infinitum, supposing that intention can be rigorously defined at all? Can it be related to the greatest mystery in this universe often referred to as consciousness? What if the system implements a recursion without base cases? Or is that not at all possible due to its coinductive nature? If the system under the guidance of the consciousness follows this very inductive nature whatever that means and implements an inductive process that gives rise to towels of meta-semantics in a pure and stateless fashion, what is the relationship between that and the act of practicing mindfulness and is it possible for the consciousness to utilize these towels of meta-semantics to adjust the perception of time for it to slow down accordingly?</p>
<p>More curiously, at the face of death will the conscious perception of time slow down factorially as neurons die and synapses break and will such a slow down of time results in an entirely different structure governing the <em>consciousness interpreter</em> giving rise to a different conscious experience and as long as some form of consistency persists then that will be some sort of another life in another world which given the fractal nature of this universe is not at all hard to be implemented if this universe follows a certain implementation whatever that mean and thus never arriving at death for such slow down decelerates and decelerates and it is life-within-life and world-within-world akin to a recursive call that never ends, an infinity embedded within finiteness like the topological nature of a continuous line of finite length containing infinitely many points, or will there be no slow down at all and awaits us all is simply eternal oblivion, the simplest solution of it all?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of <em>all these</em>?</p>
<p>What constitutes meaning really? Feelings and memories?</p>
<p>Perhaps the word <em>meaning</em> is as empty as emptiness is.</p>
<p><br> <br></p>
<p>感觉好像很多事情都看清了，<br> 然而好像還是很迷茫。</p>
<p>已经没法回去了，<br> 起碼終於意識到。</p>
<p>兜兜转转，紛紛擾擾，<br> 现在任命了。</p>
<p>每次回到起點，<br> 都离邊界更近了。</p>
<p>夢中的夢里，<br> 沒有音樂。</p>]]></description>

    <title>on losing interest</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/chapter2/lost.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Interest is like a sprinkle of dust</p>
<p>Lost casually in the whisper of the wind</p>
<p>When they are not lost they accumulate and become colonies</p>
<p>where bacteria and fungi meet and dance and sing</p>
<p>and forget about the night</p>
<p>Death is upon them</p>
<p>the same way death is upon us</p>
<p>I could have made out with you the first night we met</p>
<p>when we were in your room</p>
<p>I moved away from you as you moved close to me</p>
<p>I was shy and killed the conversation</p>
<p>I paid the rent and left in a hurry</p>
<p>I could have made out with you the second night we met</p>
<p>when we were in your room</p>
<p>I commented on how sad the song was and killed the night</p>
<p>when I could have hugged you and licked your tears and sorrow away</p>
<p>we were both so drunk and stoned and happy that we met</p>
<p>a song played and reminded you of a memory</p>
<p>I sat there savoring the sadness in your misted eyes</p>
<p>without actually tasting them</p>
<p>I could have made out with you that Friday night</p>
<p>when I was on acid and you got really drunk and started flirting with me in the bar</p>
<p>in the backseat of the car you leaned towards me and let me touch your thigh</p>
<p>but that was the wrong night</p>
<p>and then there were the nights</p>
<p>that were not the wrong nights</p>
<p>I could have made out with you</p>
<p>I always killed the night too late</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Sexy little thing, you are growing old</p>
<p>You are growing old and forgetting about things</p>
<p>You are growing old and losing interest in things</p>
<p>Sexy little thing, I’m growing old</p>
<p>I’m growing old and forgetting about things</p>
<p>I’m growing old and losing interest in things</p>
<p>I boarded the train</p>
<p>the moment it no longer saddened me</p>
<p>when I toyed with the idea of never seeing you again.</p>
<p>Thanks for the love</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I miss you</p>]]></description>

    <title>1st July 2019: Madama Butterfly (2019)</title>
    <link>https://0a.io/pretentious-reviews/film/madama-butterfly.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>A 2019 reproduction of 1904’s opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madama_Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a> (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a>), <a href="https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/madama-butterfly-sydney">Madama Butterfly (choreographed by Graeme Murphy) presented by Opera Australia</a> retells the century-old story in a somewhat contemporary manner while retaining the traditional art form of Italian opera.</p>
<p>Intermingled with English and Japanese words (as originally intended by Puccini), the emotional Italian-styled composition is met with avant-garde props, costumes and scenic designs (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole experience because the mechanical suspended stage in a unfathomable shape, moving, rotating, and tilting in unfathomable ways above the main stage gives a very beautiful contemporary twist to the whole composition) to fit the 21st century’s post-modernistic needs of combinatorial amusement, which in turn creates a somewhat surreal experience, if sad Japanese characters speaking Italiano feverishly in operatic voices is not surreal enough.</p>
<p>It was an overall delightful and satisfying experience, though many elements of the composition may sometimes feel cliché but often in a somewhat cute way (which is perhaps one of the many beauties of Italian opera). As much as I was moved a little bit to tears by the liveliness in the performance by the lovely members of Opera Australia in terms of feeling the raw emotions expressed within the libretto, the liveliness in the performance made me a little bit sad too in regard to how little Italiano I had picked up while I was in Alassio and Milano with my beautiful Italiano friends. It would have been a life-transforming experience if I were able to make out more Italiano words buried in these passionate operatic voices coated with orchestral dramatism, other than just words like <em>complemento</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a very touristic experience as well due to how famous and easily-accessible the venue is, which in many ways dilutes the artistic value, especially considering the number of people (presumedly tourists) that coughed without covering their mouths during the entire performance. Or perhaps this is the rationale behind paying $600 for the best seat in the theater where you are far away from people.</p>

    <title>a half-assed poem, amended </title>
    <link>https://0a.io/chapter2/suzanne.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It hurts.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know I will never meet someone like you again.</p>
<p>You are the woman I would love to grow old with.</p>
<p>I know you care about me.</p>
<p>It hurts because I know I won’t want to meet you again, despite how much you adore me.</p>
<p>I have met death and I want to make things right this life, and I want to be the one who makes things right in your life.</p>
<p>I know things will not be so surreal with the next girl (or guy that smells nice), unless I get extremely lucky, which is statistically improbable and it will be in a different setting and I am growing old and it will be new memories and it will not be you.</p>
<p>It hurts because deep down I know I have self-deceptive tendencies and tend to romanticise things too much.</p>
<p>I believe in synchronizität<sup><a href="#words">[1]</a></sup> and I believe there is a reason behind meeting you.</p>
<p>But perhaps the reason behind meeting you is so I can immerse myself in this beautiful feeling of hurt. So I will be wiser. So I can become a psychopath, or an artist, and make a million dollar. And then forget about your name.</p>
<p>It hurts because I really like you as a friend and I believe the connection we have made is something special that will grow into something really beautiful. And I have to cut this connection right now so that I can focus on work, instead of getting distracted because you are a fucking enchantress. And I value my work.</p>
<p>I know I won’t want to meet you again, despite how much I enjoyed the sophisticated side of you.</p>
<p>The clumsy side of you is super cute too, though I have fallen for the sophistication and the sadness in your eyes.</p>
<p>It is disappointing that the men who you slept with that I have met were much less sophisticated than you.</p>
<p>It hurts because a part of me loved and cared about you in some ambiguous and platonic sense. Or maybe I just felt pity for you.</p>
<p>That Wednesday night was very disappointing too. Of course, I had myself to blame as well.</p>
<p>And you reminded me so much of my ex. That’s the part where it hurts the most, I guess.</p>
<p>It hurts, but it was good, wasn’t it?</p>
