<p>At this rate the brain would continue to deteriorate and there will soon be nothing left other than tendencies and memories, and then there will be nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a formal language point of view, what is the set of features that enables a system to construct expressions with connotations that question the system’s very own existence and the subsequent construction of this very question that questions the very construction per se? Perhaps there exists a set of principles that make possible a class of recursive processes on the semantics itself giving rise to some form of meta-semantics which is circular in nature? In that case, exactly how will this mechanism be implemented in a way that enables the system to halt and construct the expressions as intended(?) rather than going on and on ad infinitum, supposing that intention can be rigorously defined at all? Can it be related to the greatest mystery in this universe often referred to as consciousness? What if the system implements a recursion without base cases? Or is that not at all possible due to its coinductive nature? If the system under the guidance of the consciousness follows this very inductive nature whatever that means and implements an inductive process that gives rise to towels of meta-semantics in a pure and stateless fashion, what is the relationship between that and the act of practicing mindfulness and is it possible for the consciousness to utilize these towels of meta-semantics to adjust the perception of time for it to slow down accordingly?</p>
<p>More curiously, at the face of death will the conscious perception of time slow down factorially as neurons die and synapses break and will such a slow down of time results in an entirely different structure governing the <em>consciousness interpreter</em> giving rise to a different conscious experience and as long as some form of consistency persists then that will be some sort of another life in another world which given the fractal nature of this universe is not at all hard to be implemented if this universe follows a certain implementation whatever that mean and thus never arriving at death for such slow down decelerates and decelerates and it is life-within-life and world-within-world akin to a recursive call that never ends, an infinity embedded within finiteness like the topological nature of a continuous line of finite length containing infinitely many points, or will there be no slow down at all and awaits us all is simply eternal oblivion, the simplest solution of it all?</p>
<p>What is the meaning of <em>all these</em>?</p>
<p>What constitutes meaning really? Feelings and memories?</p>
<p>Perhaps the word <em>meaning</em> is as empty as emptiness is.</p>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A 2019 reproduction of 1904’s opera <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madama_Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a> (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a>), <a href="https://opera.org.au/whatson/events/madama-butterfly-sydney">Madama Butterfly (choreographed by Graeme Murphy) presented by Opera Australia</a> retells the century-old story in a somewhat contemporary manner while retaining the traditional art form of Italian opera.</p>
<p>Intermingled with English and Japanese words (as originally intended by Puccini), the emotional Italian-styled composition is met with avant-garde props, costumes and scenic designs (which in my opinion is the best part of the whole experience because the mechanical suspended stage in a unfathomable shape, moving, rotating, and tilting in unfathomable ways above the main stage gives a very beautiful contemporary twist to the whole composition) to fit the 21st century’s post-modernistic needs of combinatorial amusement, which in turn creates a somewhat surreal experience, if sad Japanese characters speaking Italiano feverishly in operatic voices is not surreal enough.</p>
<p>It was an overall delightful and satisfying experience, though many elements of the composition may sometimes feel cliché but often in a somewhat cute way (which is perhaps one of the many beauties of Italian opera). As much as I was moved a little bit to tears by the liveliness in the performance by the lovely members of Opera Australia in terms of feeling the raw emotions expressed within the libretto, the liveliness in the performance made me a little bit sad too in regard to how little Italiano I had picked up while I was in Alassio and Milano with my beautiful Italiano friends. It would have been a life-transforming experience if I were able to make out more Italiano words buried in these passionate operatic voices coated with orchestral dramatism, other than just words like <em>complemento</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was a very touristic experience as well due to how famous and easily-accessible the venue is, which in many ways dilutes the artistic value, especially considering the number of people (presumedly tourists) that coughed without covering their mouths during the entire performance. Or perhaps this is the rationale behind paying $600 for the best seat in the theater where you are far away from people.</p>

<p>The clumsy side of you is super cute too, though I have fallen for the sophistication and the sadness in your eyes.</p>
<p>It is disappointing that the men who you slept with that I have met were much less sophisticated than you.</p>
<p>It hurts because a part of me loved and cared about you in some ambiguous and platonic sense. Or maybe I just felt pity for you.</p>
<p>That Wednesday night was very disappointing too. Of course, I had myself to blame as well.</p>

    <title>death, infinity, and strategical sociopathic behaviours</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every time we grow a little bit conscious about the realistic notion of our death, we become a little bit more serious, amidst playfulness, towards what songs should be played in our funeral and what the remaining future of our time in existence ought to look and feel like. In the face of death goals surface themselves like shipwrecks on desert. These goals are where meaning can be derived from. In many ways these goals promise us infinities. But infinities tend to desert goals. After all, goals are not in good terms with romanticism and our love for heuristic wandering and the wonderful practice of not doing. Everything unrelated to the execution towards these goals can feel like a waste of time. But what is existential time without infinity? That is the question that has troubled Jobs, Zuckerburg, Thiel and Elon.</p>
<p>Infinity is a mistress. She toys with our feelings while rendering us amnesiac and apathetic towards the future. She is the manifestation of the present in its purest form. She is what orgasm feels like without its subsequent death. She is what the commitment to suicide encapsulates without the impurities. To truly be a master of yourself is to master infinity the way one masters a slave.</p>
<p>Society is constantly at war with itself. After all, society exists to operate systems the same way our social tendencies are merely genetic expressions under computation. From a goal-orientated point of view many forms of socialisation can be viewed as a pure waste of time. Nonetheless, socialisation is in general nice in terms of the joy it sparks, etc, and the human relations formed in the long run. But not all joys are useful towards fulfilling our goals the same way not all human relations worth our time. Most humans are extremely unintelligent after all (especially to you, my dear friend, who somewhat appreciates my writings). And even when some are intelligent (or artistically inclined in the sense wherefrom intelligence can be derived) in one aspect or another, such intelligence and artsiness are rarely expressed in social functions containing more than n persons for a sufficiently large n. Overall, meeting strangers is fun. But further social intercourses with the same strangers (who gradually lose, for the lack of a better word, <em>strangeness</em>) risks dilution into uneventfulness, unless in rare cases where friendship is developed. But behind every beautiful friendship there is a cost of maintenance in terms of time, energy, etc, which in terms come with their own opportunity costs. Of course, maintaining friendship is always a pleasurable thing. And it is always fascinating to see friendship ages over the years like fine wine. But we only have so much time and energy during our existence and then we are dead.</p>
<p>In order to truly master infinities in a society’s setting, the art of strategical sociopathic behaviours (i.e. the behavioural deviation from social norms and antisocial patterns in general, under a somewhat game theoretical framework) needs to be learned and employed. We ought to appreciate sociopathic behaviours for they demonstrate a somewhat absolute control of self and the wonderful acknowledgement regarding the transient nature of time. After all, death awaits us all and we ought to learn when to leave some infinities behind for other infinities, or momentarily abandon infinities for the sweet promises derived from goals that reflect the future we look forwards to. Even if the act of doing so may hurt others a little. Even if the act of doing so may hurt our soul a little. Time is limited. Strategical sociopathic behaviours work wonders in constrained optimisation problems<sup>[1]</sup>.</p>
<p>And we ought to take caution towards our empathetic inclination. Empathy is a double-edged sword. The trick here is not to point it to yourself nor to the world but to appreciate the elegance of its craft the same way you appreciate solitude and treat it as the most luxurious gift you can ever give to yourself. The idea here is to always enjoy yourself in spending time with virtually anyone and as you do so you make sure the time with you is enjoyable to them too. In many ways it means becoming an expert in emotional attunenment (through the fine utilization of our empathetic faculty, sensibility and interpersonal skills) and an expert in enjoying yourself (by finding amusement in literally everything). Meanwhile, deep down your heart you have fully surrendered yourself to the acknowledgement that after each meeting with strangers and friends you may never get to see them again. You are the captain of your own ship and you are free to leave for another world and never come back. The only thing that binds you to them is the future, the future of promised infinities. And when they disengage from your future infinities or your future infinities desert them as future unfolds itself and promises metamorphose and dissipate, you are free to dissipate from their world too. Even if it may make them sad. Even if it may make you sad. Sadness is beautiful. Embrace your death in their world, and their deaths in yours. For you are the true master of infinities. For infinities are your slaves.</p>
<p>Still, invite them to your funeral if they are nice people.</p>
